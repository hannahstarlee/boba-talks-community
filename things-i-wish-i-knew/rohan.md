## before going to college
- Really give some time to yourself to mentally prepare for a rollercoaster of an adventure.
- Something that really helped me going into college was not going into the expectation of it being easy to navigate, and then overloading on courses (especially STEM). At least for the first semester/quarter, it's very important not to jump straight into it because it really is a different world. And moves at a very fast pace.
- Genuinely give your best effort and enjoy the years of college. Before I even realized graduation is around the corner and although I have tried and done everything possible with my time in college, I've noticed not everyone has that opportunity so it's important to take the time to enjoy the small parts of college.  

## reflection  

This matters to me a lot because being a graduating senior now, I've self-reflected and realized there's almost nothing I would have changed or done differently, but having asked my friends around me, there's always hundreds of things that they wish they spent learning, doing, enjoying, or not doing.
It's completely ok to make mistakes, but not taking the risk to do something you want to do is what I have learned to be the most valuable lesson of college; it's ok to take the risk and pursue what you want, most likely it will also be more fun!
