## before college 
- It’s okay to not know what you want yet.
I used to be frustrated that I didn’t have my “thing” figured out in high school. But that’s totally normal. You can’t blame yourself for not having it all sorted out early. What matters more is staying open to trying new things, because that’s how you eventually discover what clicks.
- You don’t need to be at a certain school to do “big school” things.
I used to think that because I wasn’t at UW Seattle, I couldn’t participate in their events or join their organizations. Totally wrong. You can always find ways to get involved such as DubHacks, UWVSA, NWVSA, and other interschool events have shown me that college isn’t about where you go, but what you do with what’s around you.
- Friendships need maintenance.
Meeting new people is exciting, but I’ve learned how important it is to “water your plants”; to keep up with and care for your close friends. I used to overthink who my “real friends” were, but now I know it’s not that serious. If you trust and show up for the people who matter, those relationships will grow naturally.
## reflection  
It’s been about a year into college now, and honestly, things have been going pretty well. I was disappointed at first about not going to UW Seattle, but I’ve learned to make the most of where I am. Dorming my first year was one of the best choices I made since it pushed me to connect with people and experience life outside my comfort zone.
I’ve also tried to take a “yes, and” approach: saying yes to opportunities even if they’re small or uncertain. That mindset has made my college experience feel a lot fuller, especially since my time here is technically shorter because of Running Start.
This year, I decided to treat DubHacks like a convention instead of a stressful project grind, and it was such a refreshing change. Last year I needed the projects for my resume, but now I can enjoy things for what they are, learning experiences and chances to vibe with people.
Starting to DJ at the campus radio station has been life-changing. I stalled on music for a while, but once I got on air, everything clicked. When I finally started posting about DJing and showing my face online, people actually noticed and supported it. It reminded me how much good can come from sharing what you love, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.
Overall, the biggest thing I’ve learned is that getting out of your comfort zone, trusting people, and taking opportunities as they come is what makes college fulfilling. You can’t control everything, but you can keep saying yes, keep growing, and keep watering the plants that matter most.
